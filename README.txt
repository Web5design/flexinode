A ENTITY API based implementation of the Drupal 6 flexifield module (http://drupal.org/project/flexifield),
This is not a port, from the above mentioned module, but a new from scratch implementation hence there is no upgrade path available.


Flexinodes are fieldable entities that can be embedded into a host entity.
The main difference between this project and field_collection is that flexinodes allow a sitebuilder to define more then one fieldable flexinode entity per host field instead and share the flexinode entities between host fields. A true many to many relation between Host entity and flexinode's.

More information at this moment can be found on my blog : http://renebakx.nl/65/sneak-peak-into-flexifields-for-drupal-7/

A big thanks to the guys from Freie Formation and leonevers for providing some patches.
