A new implementation of the Drupal 6 flexifield (http://drupal.org/project/flexifield),
and since this is not a straight forwarded port I believe this was worthy of a own project within the drupal Ecosphere.

Flexinodes are fieldable entities that can be embedded into a host entity.
The big difference between this and field_collection and other project like those is is that a host can have
multiple variations of a flexinode attached instead of just one type.


At this moment this module is for the advanced drupal user, since theming and UI support is at a very basic level.

More information at this moment can be found on my blog : http://renebakx.nl/65/sneak-peak-into-flexifields-for-drupal-7/
